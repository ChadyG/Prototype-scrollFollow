This is a Prototype conversion of the jQuery plugin scrollFollow.
You can find the original script at the following URL
http://code.google.com/p/jquery-scroll-follow/

I could not find an existing javascript snippet to set up making a DOM Element scroll 
with the page that worked using Prototype and script.aculo.us so I ended up converting 
this jQuery snippet.  Most of the functionality has been kept, save for a few things 
listed below.  


Current isues:
 - The original script including optional functionality for user preference to not scroll and binding to a toggle element to turn the scrolling off, I left this functionality out in favor of getting the core working.
 - The offset parameter doesn't seem to work correctly, and not at all in Opera.
 - Probably more...
